# Question: How do you implement a basic finite state machine for parsing text commands? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript code provided is a simple implementation of a finite state machine for parsing text commands. The code defines a StateMachine class that maintains a dictionary of states and the current state. The StateMachine class has three methods: addState, transition, and execute. The addState method is used to add new states to the state machine, while the transition method is used to change the current state of the machine. The execute method is used to execute a command in the current state. The State class is a base class for all states, and it defines an execute method that throws an error if it is not overridden in a derived class. The CommandState and NextState classes are derived from the State class and override the execute method to execute commands and transition to other states. The last part of the code creates a state machine, adds the CommandState and NextState states to it, and executes some commands. This code provides a basic framework for a finite state machine that can be used to parse and execute text commands.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution uses a different approach to solve the problem compared to the JavaScript version. 

In the JavaScript version, the state machine is implemented using classes and inheritance. The `StateMachine` class maintains a dictionary of states and the current state. The `State` class is a base class for all states, and the `CommandState` and `NextState` classes are derived from the `State` class and override the `execute` method to execute commands and transition to other states.

In the TypeScript version, the state machine is implemented using an enum and a class. The `State` enum defines the states of the machine, and the `CommandParser` class maintains the current state and the parsed command and argument. The `parse` method reads the input string one character at a time and transitions between states based on the current character.

The TypeScript version uses the `enum` language feature, which is not available in JavaScript. Enums allow for a more structured and type-safe way to define a set of named constants. This makes the code more readable and less error-prone.

The TypeScript version also uses type annotations to specify the types of variables and function return values. This provides compile-time type checking, which can help catch errors early.

The TypeScript version does not use inheritance, which makes the code simpler and easier to understand. Instead of having to override a method in a derived class, the `parse` method directly implements the logic for executing commands and transitioning between states.

The TypeScript version also resets the command and argument after parsing, which allows the same `CommandParser` instance to be used to parse multiple commands. In contrast, the JavaScript version creates a new state machine for each command.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution uses a different approach to solve the problem compared to the JavaScript version. 

In the JavaScript version, the state machine is implemented using classes and objects. The `StateMachine` class maintains a dictionary of states and the current state. The `State` class is a base class for all states, and the `CommandState` and `NextState` classes are derived from the `State` class and override the `execute` method to execute commands and transition to other states. The `execute` method in the `StateMachine` class is used to execute a command in the current state.

In the C++ version, the state machine is implemented using an enum class for the states and a map of maps for the transitions. The `StateMachine` class maintains a map of transitions, where each transition is a map from a function that checks a condition on a character to a state. The `parse` method in the `StateMachine` class is used to parse a string of text and execute commands based on the transitions.

The C++ version uses the `std::map` and `std::function` classes from the Standard Library, which are not available in JavaScript. It also uses the `enum class` feature, which is a type-safe version of enums in C++. The JavaScript version uses the `class` feature and the `new` keyword to create objects, which are not available in C++.

The C++ version also uses a different way to handle the transitions between states. It uses a map of maps, where each map is a transition from a state to another state based on a condition on a character. The JavaScript version uses the `transition` method in the `StateMachine` class to transition between states.

In terms of functionality, both versions solve the problem in a similar way. They both implement a finite state machine for parsing text commands, but they use different language features and methods to do so.
